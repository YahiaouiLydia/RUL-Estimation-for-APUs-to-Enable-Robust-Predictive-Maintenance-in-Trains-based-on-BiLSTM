This project focuses on enhancing predictive maintenance (PdM) in the railway industry by introducing a novel method for estimating the Remaining Useful Life (RUL) of train air production units (APUs). By employing advanced deep learning techniques, specifically a Bidirectional Long Short-Term Memory (BiLSTM) network, we analyze intricate temporal patterns in sensor data to achieve more accurate RUL predictions. This approach aims to facilitate early failure detection and optimize maintenance strategies, ultimately improving operational efficiency. For more details, please refer to the conference article titled Remaining Useful Life Estimation for Air Production Units to Enable Robust Predictive Maintenance in Trains Based on BiLSTM, which will be published soon in the BIWA 2024 conference.
